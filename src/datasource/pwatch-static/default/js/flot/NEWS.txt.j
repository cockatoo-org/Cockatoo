Code using dual axes should be changed from\nusing x2axis\/y2axis in the options to using an array (although\nbackwards-compatibility hooks are in place). For instance,\n\n  {\n    xaxis: { ... }, x2axis: { ... },\n    yaxis: { ... }, y2axis: { ... }\n  }\n\nbecomes\n\n  {\n    xaxes: [ { ... }, { ... } ],\n    yaxes: [ { ... }, { ... } ]\n  }\n\nNote that if you're just using one axis, continue to use the\nxaxis\/yaxis directly (it now sets the default settings for the\narrays). Plugins touching the axes must be ported to take the extra\naxes into account, check the source to see some examples.\n\nA related change is that the visibility of axes is now auto-detected.\nSo if you were relying on an axis to show up even without any data in\nthe chart, you now need to set the axis \"show\" option explicitly.\n\n\"tickColor\" on the grid options is now deprecated in favour of a\ncorresponding option on the axes, so { grid: { tickColor: \"#000\" }}\nbecomes { xaxis: { tickColor: \"#000\"}, yaxis: { tickColor: \"#000\"} },\nbut if you just configure a base color Flot will now autogenerate a\ntick color by adding transparency. Backwards-compatibility hooks are\nin place.\n\nFinal note: now that IE 9 is coming out with canvas support, you may\nwant to adapt the excanvas include to skip loading it in IE 9 (the\nexamples have been adapted thanks to Ryley Breiddal). An alternative\nto excanvas using Flash has also surfaced, if your graphs are slow in\nIE, you may want to give it a spin:\n\n  http:\/\/code.google.com\/p\/flashcanvas\/\n\n\nChanges:\n\n- Support for specifying a bottom for each point for line charts when\n  filling them, this means that an arbitrary bottom can be used\n  instead of just the x axis (based on patches patiently provided by\n  Roman V. Prikhodchenko).\n- New fillbetween plugin that can compute a bottom for a series from\n  another series, useful for filling areas between lines (see new\n  example percentiles.html for a use case).\n- More predictable handling of gaps for the stacking plugin, now all\n  undefined ranges are skipped.\n- Stacking plugin can stack horizontal bar charts.\n- Navigate plugin now redraws the plot while panning instead of only\n  after the fact (can be disabled by setting the pan.frameRate option\n  to null), raised by lastthemy (issue 235).\n- Date formatter now accepts %0m and %0d to get a zero-padded month or\n  day (issue raised by Maximillian Dornseif).\n- Revamped internals to support an unlimited number of axes, not just\n  dual (sponsored by Flight Data Services,\n  www.flightdataservices.com).\n- New setting on axes, \"tickLength\", to control the size of ticks or\n  turn them off without turning off the labels.\n- Axis labels are now put in container divs with classes, for instance\n  labels in the x axes can be reached via \".xAxis .tickLabel\".\n- Support for setting the color of an axis (sponsored by Flight Data\n  Services, www.flightdataservices.com).\n- Tick color is now auto-generated as the base color with some\n  transparency (unless you override it).\n- Support for aligning ticks in the axes with \"alignTicksWithAxis\" to\n  ensure that they appear next to each other rather than in between,\n  at the expense of possibly awkward tick steps (sponsored by Flight\n  Data Services, www.flightdataservices.com).\n- Support for customizing the point type through a callback when\n  plotting points and new symbol plugin with some predefined point\n  types (sponsored by Utility Data Corporation).\n- Resize plugin for automatically redrawing when the placeholder\n  changes size, e.g. on window resizes (sponsored by Novus Partners).\n  A resize() method has been added to plot object facilitate this.\n- Support Infinity\/-Infinity for plotting asymptotes by hacking it\n  into +\/-Number.MAX_VALUE (reported by rabaea.mircea).\n- Support for restricting navigate plugin to not pan\/zoom an axis (based\n  on patch by kkaefer).\n- Support for providing the drag cursor for the navigate plugin as an\n  option (based on patch by Kelly T. Moore).\n- Options for controlling whether an axis is shown or not (suggestion\n  by Timo Tuominen) and whether to reserve space for it even if it\n  isn't shown.\n- New attribute $.plot.version with the Flot version as a string.\n- The version comment is now included in the minified jquery.flot.min.js.\n- New options.grid.minBorderMargin for adjusting the minimum margin\n  provided around the border (based on patch by corani, issue 188).\n- Refactor replot behaviour so Flot tries to reuse the existing\n  canvas, adding shutdown() methods to the plot (based on patch by\n  Ryley Breiddal, issue 269). This prevents a memory leak in Chrome\n  and hopefully makes replotting faster for those who are using $.plot\n  instead of .setData()\/.draw(). Also update jQuery to 1.5.1 to\n  prevent IE leaks fixed in jQuery.\n- New real-time line chart example.\n\n- New hooks: drawSeries, shutdown\n\nBug fixes:\n\n- Fixed problem with findNearbyItem and bars on top of each other\n  (reported by ragingchikn, issue 242).\n- Fixed problem with ticks and the border (based on patch from\n  ultimatehustler69, issue 236).\n- Fixed problem with plugins adding options to the series objects.\n- Fixed a problem introduced in 0.6 with specifying a gradient with {\n  brightness: x, opacity: y }.\n- Don't use $.browser.msie, check for getContext on the created canvas\n  element instead and try to use excanvas if it's not found (fixes IE\n  9 compatibility).\n- highlight(s, index) was looking up the point in the original s.data\n  instead of in the computed datapoints array, which breaks with\n  plugins that modify the datapoints (such as the stacking plugin).\n  Issue 316 reported by curlypaul924.\n- More robust handling of axis from data passed in from getData()\n  (problem reported by Morgan).\n- Fixed problem with turning off bar outline (issue 253, fix by Jordi\n  Castells).\n- Check the selection passed into setSelection in the selection\n  plugin, to guard against errors when synchronizing plots (fix by Lau\n  Bech Lauritzen).\n- Fix bug in crosshair code with mouseout resetting the crosshair even\n  if it is locked (fix by Lau Bech Lauritzen and Banko Adam).\n- Fix bug with points plotting using line width from lines rather than\n  points.\n- Fix bug with passing non-array 0 data (for plugins that don't expect\n  arrays, patch by vpapp1).\n- Fix errors in JSON in examples so they work with jQuery 1.4.2\n  (fix reported by honestbleeps, issue 357).\n- Fix bug with tooltip in interacting.html, this makes the tooltip\n  much smoother (fix by bdkahn). Fix related bug inside highlighting\n  handler in Flot.\n- Use closure trick to make inline colorhelpers plugin respect\n  jQuery.noConflict(true), renaming the global jQuery object (reported\n  by Nick Stielau).\n- Listen for mouseleave events and fire a plothover event with empty\n  item when it occurs to drop highlights when the mouse leaves the\n  plot (reported by by outspirit).\n- Fix bug with using aboveData with a background (reported by\n  amitayd).\n- Fix possible excanvas leak (report and suggested fix by tom9729).\n- Fix bug with backwards compatibility for shadowSize = 0 (report and\n  suggested fix by aspinak).\n- Adapt examples to skip loading excanvas (fix by Ryley Breiddal).\n- Fix bug that prevent a simple f(x) = -x transform from working\n  correctly (fix by Mike, issue 263).\n- Fix bug in restoring cursor in navigate plugin (reported by Matteo\n  Gattanini, issue 395).\n- Fix bug in picking items when transform\/inverseTransform is in use\n  (reported by Ofri Raviv, and patches and analysis by Jan and Tom\n  Paton, issue 334 and 467).\n- Fix problem with unaligned ticks and hover\/click events caused by\n  padding on the placeholder by hardcoding the placeholder padding to\n  0 (reported by adityadineshsaxena, Matt Sommer, Daniel Atos and some\n  other people, issue 301).\n- Update colorhelpers plugin to avoid dying when trying to parse an\n  invalid string (reported by cadavor, issue 483).\n\n\nFlot 0.6\n--------\n\nAPI changes:\n\n1. Selection support has been moved to a plugin. Thus if you're\npassing selection: { mode: something }, you MUST include the file\njquery.flot.selection.js after jquery.flot.js. This reduces the size\nof base Flot and makes it easier to customize the selection as well as\nimproving code clarity. The change is based on a patch from andershol.\n\n2. In the global options specified in the $.plot command,\n\"lines\", \"points\", \"bars\" and \"shadowSize\" have been moved to a\nsub-object called \"series\", i.e.\n\n  $.plot(placeholder, data, { lines: { show: true }})\n\nshould be changed to\n\n  $.plot(placeholder, data, { series: { lines: { show: true }}})\n\nAll future series-specific options will go into this sub-object to\nsimplify plugin writing. Backward-compatibility code is in place, so\nold code should not break.\n\n3. \"plothover\" no longer provides the original data point, but instead\na normalized one, since there may be no corresponding original point.\n\n4. Due to a bug in previous versions of jQuery, you now need at least\njQuery 1.2.6. But if you can, try jQuery 1.3.2 as it got some\nimprovements in event handling speed.\n\n\nChanges:\n\n- Added support for disabling interactivity for specific data series\n  (request from Ronald Schouten and Steve Upton).\n\n- Flot now calls $() on the placeholder and optional legend container\n  passed in so you can specify DOM elements or CSS expressions to make\n  it easier to use Flot with libraries like Prototype or Mootools or\n  through raw JSON from Ajax responses.\n\n- A new \"plotselecting\" event is now emitted while the user is making\n  a selection.\n\n- The \"plothover\" event is now emitted immediately instead of at most\n  10 times per second, you'll have to put in a setTimeout yourself if\n  you're doing something really expensive on this event.\n\n- The built-in date formatter can now be accessed as\n  $.plot.formatDate(...) (suggestion by Matt Manela) and even\n  replaced.\n\n- Added \"borderColor\" option to the grid (patch from Amaury Chamayou\n  and patch from Mike R. Williamson).\n\n- Added support for gradient backgrounds for the grid, take a look at\n  the \"setting options\" example (based on patch from Amaury Chamayou,\n  issue 90).\n\n- Gradient bars (suggestion by stefpet).\n  \n- Added a \"plotunselected\" event which is triggered when the selection\n  is removed, see \"selection\" example (suggestion by Meda Ugo);\n\n- The option legend.margin can now specify horizontal and vertical\n  margins independently (suggestion by someone who's annoyed).\n\n- Data passed into Flot is now copied to a new canonical format to\n  enable further processing before it hits the drawing routines. As a\n  side-effect, this should make Flot more robust in the face of bad\n  data (and fixes issue 112).\n\n- Step-wise charting: line charts have a new option \"steps\" that when\n  set to true connects the points with horizontal\/vertical steps\n  instead of diagonal lines.\n\n- The legend labelFormatter now passes the series in addition to just\n  the label (suggestion by Vincent Lemeltier).\n\n- Horizontal bars (based on patch by Jason LeBrun).\n\n- Support for partial bars by specifying a third coordinate, i.e. they\n  don't have to start from the axis. This can be used to make stacked\n  bars.\n\n- New option to disable the (grid.show).\n\n- Added pointOffset method for converting a point in data space to an\n  offset within the placeholder.\n  \n- Plugin system: register an init method in the $.flot.plugins array\n  to get started, see PLUGINS.txt for details on how to write plugins\n  (it's easy). There are also some extra methods to enable access to\n  internal state.\n\n- Hooks: you can register functions that are called while Flot is\n  crunching the data and doing the plot. This can be used to modify\n  Flot without changing the source, useful for writing plugins. Some\n  hooks are defined, more are likely to come.\n  \n- Threshold plugin: you can set a threshold and a color, and the data\n  points below that threshold will then get the color. Useful for\n  marking data below 0, for instance.\n\n- Stack plugin: you can specify a stack key for each series to have\n  them summed. This is useful for drawing additive\/cumulative graphs\n  with bars and (currently unfilled) lines.\n\n- Crosshairs plugin: trace the mouse position on the axes, enable with\n  crosshair: { mode: \"x\"} (see the new tracking example for a use).\n\n- Image plugin: plot prerendered images.\n\n- Navigation plugin for panning and zooming a plot.\n\n- More configurable grid.\n\n- Axis transformation support, useful for non-linear plots, e.g. log\n  axes and compressed time axes (like omitting weekends).\n\n- Support for twelve-hour date formatting (patch by Forrest Aldridge).\n\n- The color parsing code in Flot has been cleaned up and split out so\n  it's now available as a separate jQuery plugin. It's included inline\n  in the Flot source to make dependency managing easier. This also\n  makes it really easy to use the color helpers in Flot plugins.\n\nBug fixes:\n\n- Fixed two corner-case bugs when drawing filled curves (report and\n  analysis by Joshua Varner).\n- Fix auto-adjustment code when setting min to 0 for an axis where the\n  dataset is completely flat on that axis (report by chovy).\n- Fixed a bug with passing in data from getData to setData when the\n  secondary axes are used (issue 65, reported by nperelman).\n- Fixed so that it is possible to turn lines off when no other chart\n  type is shown (based on problem reported by Glenn Vanderburg), and\n  fixed so that setting lineWidth to 0 also hides the shadow (based on\n  problem reported by Sergio Nunes).\n- Updated mousemove position expression to the latest from jQuery (bug\n  reported by meyuchas).\n- Use CSS borders instead of background in legend (fix printing issue 25\n  and 45).\n- Explicitly convert axis min\/max to numbers.\n- Fixed a bug with drawing marking lines with different colors\n  (reported by Khurram).\n- Fixed a bug with returning y2 values in the selection event (fix\n  by exists, issue 75).\n- Only set position relative on placeholder if it hasn't already a\n  position different from static (reported by kyberneticist, issue 95).\n- Don't round markings to prevent sub-pixel problems (reported by Dan\n  Lipsitt).\n- Make the grid border act similarly to a regular CSS border, i.e.\n  prevent it from overlapping the plot itself. This also fixes a\n  problem with anti-aliasing when the width is 1 pixel (reported by\n  Anthony Ettinger).\n- Imported version 3 of excanvas and fixed two issues with the newer\n  version. Hopefully, this will make Flot work with IE8 (nudge by\n  Fabien Menager, further analysis by Booink, issue 133).\n- Changed the shadow code for lines to hopefully look a bit better\n  with vertical lines.\n- Round tick positions to avoid possible problems with fractions\n  (suggestion by Fred, issue 130).\n- Made the heuristic for determining how many ticks to aim for a bit\n  smarter.\n- Fix for uneven axis margins (report and patch by Paul Kienzle) and\n  snapping to ticks (concurrent report and patch by lifthrasiir).\n- Fixed bug with slicing in findNearbyItems (patch by zollman).\n- Make heuristic for x axis label widths more dynamic (patch by\n  rickinhethuis).\n- Make sure points on top take precedence when finding nearby points\n  when hovering (reported by didroe, issue 224).\n\nFlot 0.5\n--------\n\nBackwards API change summary: Timestamps are now in UTC. Also\n\"selected\" event -> becomes \"plotselected\" with new data, the\nparameters for setSelection are now different (but backwards\ncompatibility hooks are in place), coloredAreas becomes markings with\na new interface (but backwards compatibility hooks are in place).\n\n\nInteractivity: added a new \"plothover\" event and this and the\n\"plotclick\" event now returns the closest data item (based on patch by\n\/david, patch by Mark Byers for bar support). See the revamped\n\"interacting with the data\" example for some hints on what you can do.\n\nHighlighting: you can now highlight points and datapoints are\nautohighlighted when you hover over them (if hovering is turned on).\n\nSupport for dual axis has been added (based on patch by someone who's\nannoyed and \/david). For each data series you can specify which axes\nit belongs to, and there are two more axes, x2axis and y2axis, to\ncustomize. This affects the \"selected\" event which has been renamed to\n\"plotselected\" and spews out { xaxis: { from: -10, to: 20 } ... },\nsetSelection in which the parameters are on a new form (backwards\ncompatible hooks are in place so old code shouldn't break) and\nmarkings (formerly coloredAreas).\n\nTimestamps in time mode are now displayed according to\nUTC instead of the time zone of the visitor. This affects the way the\ntimestamps should be input; you'll probably have to offset the\ntimestamps according to your local time zone. It also affects any\ncustom date handling code (which basically now should use the\nequivalent UTC date mehods, e.g. .setUTCMonth() instead of\n.setMonth().\n\nAdded support for specifying the size of tick labels (axis.labelWidth,\naxis.labelHeight). Useful for specifying a max label size to keep\nmultiple plots aligned.\n\nMarkings, previously coloredAreas, are now specified as ranges on the\naxes, like { xaxis: { from: 0, to: 10 }}. Furthermore with markings\nyou can now draw horizontal\/vertical lines by setting from and to to\nthe same coordinate (idea from line support patch by by Ryan Funduk).\n\nThe \"fill\" option can now be a number that specifies the opacity of\nthe fill.\n\nYou can now specify a coordinate as null (like [2, null]) and Flot\nwill take the other coordinate into account when scaling the axes\n(based on patch by joebno).\n\nNew option for bars \"align\". Set it to \"center\" to center the bars on\nthe value they represent.\n\nsetSelection now takes a second parameter which you can use to prevent\nthe method from firing the \"plotselected\" handler. \n\nUsing the \"container\" option in legend now overwrites the container\nelement instead of just appending to it (fixes infinite legend bug,\nreported by several people, fix by Brad Dewey).\n\nFixed a bug in calculating spacing around the plot (reported by\ntimothytoe). Fixed a bug in finding max values for all-negative data\nsets. Prevent the possibility of eternal looping in tick calculations.\nFixed a bug when borderWidth is set to 0 (reported by\nRob\/sanchothefat). Fixed a bug with drawing bars extending below 0\n(reported by James Hewitt, patch by Ryan Funduk). Fixed a\nbug with line widths of bars (reported by MikeM). Fixed a bug with\n'nw' and 'sw' legend positions. Improved the handling of axis\nauto-scaling with bars. Fixed a bug with multi-line x-axis tick\nlabels (reported by Luca Ciano). IE-fix help by Savage Zhang.\n\n\nFlot 0.4\n--------\n\nAPI changes: deprecated axis.noTicks in favor of just specifying the\nnumber as axis.ticks. So \"xaxis: { noTicks: 10 }\" becomes\n\"xaxis: { ticks: 10 }\"\n\nTime series support. Specify axis.mode: \"time\", put in Javascript\ntimestamps as data, and Flot will automatically spit out sensible\nticks. Take a look at the two new examples. The format can be\ncustomized with axis.timeformat and axis.monthNames, or if that fails\nwith axis.tickFormatter.\n\nSupport for colored background areas via grid.coloredAreas. Specify an\narray of { x1, y1, x2, y2 } objects or a function that returns these\ngiven { xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax }.\n\nMore members on the plot object (report by Chris Davies and others).\n\"getData\" for inspecting the assigned settings on data series (e.g.\ncolor) and \"setData\", \"setupGrid\" and \"draw\" for updating the contents\nwithout a total replot.\n\nThe default number of ticks to aim for is now dependent on the size of\nthe plot in pixels. Support for customizing tick interval sizes\ndirectly with axis.minTickSize and axis.tickSize.\n\nCleaned up the automatic axis scaling algorithm and fixed how it\ninteracts with ticks. Also fixed a couple of tick-related corner case\nbugs (one reported by mainstreetmark, another reported by timothytoe).\n\nThe option axis.tickFormatter now takes a function with two\nparameters, the second parameter is an optional object with\ninformation about the axis. It has min, max, tickDecimals, tickSize.\n\nAdded support for segmented lines (based on patch from Michael\nMacDonald) and for ignoring null and bad values (suggestion from Nick\nKonidaris and joshwaihi). \n\nAdded support for changing the border width (joebno and safoo).\nLabel colors can be changed via CSS by selecting the tickLabel class.\n\nFixed a bug in handling single-item bar series (reported by Emil\nFilipov). Fixed erratic behaviour when interacting with the plot\nwith IE 7 (reported by Lau Bech Lauritzen). Prevent IE\/Safari text\nselection when selecting stuff on the canvas.\n\n\n\nFlot 0.3\n--------\n\nThis is mostly a quick-fix release because jquery.js wasn't included\nin the previous zip\/tarball.\n\nSupport clicking on the plot. Turn it on with grid: { clickable: true },\nthen you get a \"plotclick\" event on the graph placeholder with the\nposition in units of the plot.\n\nFixed a bug in dealing with data where min = max, thanks to Michael\nMessinides.\n\nInclude jquery.js in the zip\/tarball.\n\n\nFlot 0.2\n--------\n\nAdded support for putting a background behind the default legend. The\ndefault is the partly transparent background color. Added\nbackgroundColor and backgroundOpacity to the legend options to control\nthis.\n\nThe ticks options can now be a callback function that takes one\nparameter, an object with the attributes min and max. The function\nshould return a ticks array.\n\nAdded labelFormatter option in legend, useful for turning the legend\nlabels into links.\n\nFixed a couple of bugs.\n\nThe API should now be fully documented.\n\nPatch from Guy Fraser to make parts of the code smaller.\n\nAPI changes: Moved labelMargin option to grid from x\/yaxis.\n\n\nFlot 0.1\n--------\n\nFirst public release.\n","_u":"js\/flot\/NEWS.txt"}
