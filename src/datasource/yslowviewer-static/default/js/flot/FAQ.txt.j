The excanvas emulation used for IE (built with\nVML) makes IE by far the slowest browser so be sure to test with that\nif IE users are in your target group.\n\n1000 points is not a problem, but as soon as you start having more\npoints than the pixel width, you should probably start thinking about\ndownsampling\/aggregation as this is near the resolution limit of the\nchart anyway. If you downsample server-side, you also save bandwidth.\n\n\nQ: Flot isn't working when I'm using JSON data as source!\n\nA: Actually, Flot loves JSON data, you just got the format wrong.\nDouble check that you're not inputting strings instead of numbers,\nlike [[\"0\", \"-2.13\"], [\"5\", \"4.3\"]]. This is most common mistake, and\nthe error might not show up immediately because Javascript can do some\nconversion automatically.\n\n\nQ: Can I export the graph?\n\nA: This is a limitation of the canvas technology. There's a hook in\nthe canvas object for getting an image out, but you won't get the tick\nlabels. And it's not likely to be supported by IE. At this point, your\nbest bet is probably taking a screenshot, e.g. with PrtScn.\n\n\nQ: The bars are all tiny in time mode?\n\nA: It's not really possible to determine the bar width automatically.\nSo you have to set the width with the barWidth option which is NOT in\npixels, but in the units of the x axis (or the y axis for horizontal\nbars). For time mode that's milliseconds so the default value of 1\nmakes the bars 1 millisecond wide.\n\n\nQ: Can I use Flot with libraries like Mootools or Prototype?\n\nA: Yes, Flot supports it out of the box and it's easy! Just use jQuery\ninstead of $, e.g. call jQuery.plot instead of $.plot and use\njQuery(something) instead of $(something). As a convenience, you can\nput in a DOM element for the graph placeholder where the examples and\nthe API documentation are using jQuery objects.\n\nDepending on how you include jQuery, you may have to add one line of\ncode to prevent jQuery from overwriting functions from the other\nlibraries, see the documentation in jQuery (\"Using jQuery with other\nlibraries\") for details.\n\n\nQ: Flot doesn't work with [insert name of Javascript UI framework]!\n\nA: The only non-standard thing used by Flot is the canvas tag;\notherwise it is simply a series of absolute positioned divs within the\nplaceholder tag you put in. If this is not working, it's probably\nbecause the framework you're using is doing something weird with the\nDOM, or you're using it the wrong way.\n\nA common problem is that there's display:none on a container until the\nuser does something. Many tab widgets work this way, and there's\nnothing wrong with it - you just can't call Flot inside a display:none\ncontainer as explained in the README so you need to hold off the Flot\ncall until the container is actually displayed (or use\nvisibility:hidden instead of display:none or move the container\noff-screen).\n\nIf you find there's a specific thing we can do to Flot to help, feel\nfree to submit a bug report. Otherwise, you're welcome to ask for help\non the forum\/mailing list, but please don't submit a bug report to\nFlot.\n","_u":"js\/flot\/FAQ.txt"}
